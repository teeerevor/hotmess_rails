hottest100.io
=============

Made out of frustration with the triplej hottest100 voting app and my love catching up on music I've missed during the year.

Quick start
--

After doing all the rails rakes.

hit <tt>rake load_csv</tt> to load this years h100 song list

then

<tt>rails s</tt>

and you're away.
